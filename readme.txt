Appsila WooQuote is a plugin that enables your customers send quote requests from your woocommerce shop which will then be tracked in a full functional Appsila CRM backend provided with the plugin.  

== Description ==

Appsila WooQuote plugin enables your customers send quote requests from your WooCommerce shop which will then be tracked in a full functional Appsila CRM backend provided with the plugin. When the plugin is activated, it simply adds a 'Request a Quote' button in single product and cart pages. In WooQuote, the usual behavior of customers are not changed. If customer wants to request a quote for more than one product, he can add the products into the cart as usual and simply click Request a Quote button. After clicking the button, if user logged into your shop, membership account information is automatically gathered and populated to the request form. Otherwise; the customer can fill in the form and writes the details of his request. If customer wants to send a quote request for only one product, he can use the Request a Quote button in single product page in just as the same way in the cart page. 

One of the main difference of the Appsila WooQuote plugin when compared to the other similar plugins is that it provides not only a simple quote management, but also a full functional low-code CRM backend to your WooCommerce. With this backend application, you can track all the phases of your sales pipeline (i.e. lead in, contact made, proposal made, converted or lost), insert notes and activities, attach documents, manage your product information, your customers, tasks, calendar and reports. 

When your potential customer makes a request on your shop, a new lead generated into your CRM, the requested products are transferred into CRM products module with its main data and finally a quote is automatically generated. You notice the new quote request via an email sent to you from Appsila. By clicking the link in the email, you can instantly log into the system and view the details of the quote. You can see the message of your customer and make discounts if you wish. When applied a discount, the system automatically connects to your WooCommerce site and creates a discount coupon. You can send email to your customer with a predefined email template attached with a quote document generated automatically in your company's document format and logo. So all these issues occur just in a minute. You customer can easily apply the coupon you sent in the cart page and continue to checkout. 

The responsive design of Appsila CRM, enables you to check quote requests via your mobile phone or tablet and send quote documents to your customers while you are in mobile. 

The plugin also enables you to translate all the text labels displayed to your customers including the request a quote button text so that you can use it in any language you want.
